CrearYBorrar README
===================

Important Info!
-------------------
Update 1.9 is huge, and is a stepping stone for 2.0, the final version I will create! Of Course, as with any update, there are a few new things to now. First Of, to run from source you will now need the HighScores Library which I created for this project. You can find it under my(mathboy19's) repos. Secondly, 1.9 is a build intended for testing, and bug finding of the program, as there has been little/none on the previous builds. If you find any bugs, please put it under the issues part.

Thanks,
    Mathboy19
