CrearYBorrar README
===================

Important Info!
-------------------
The version 2.0 is going to be it for the most part, for this project, as I have other things that I want to play around with. This does not mean that I am not willing to totally give up on this project however. If you have anything you want me to fix, report it, and I'll gladly fix it for you. I hope you enjoy version 2.0!

Thanks,
